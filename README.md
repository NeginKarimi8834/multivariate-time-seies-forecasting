The dataset has 123 rows and 8 columns and the definition of columns are shown below:
rgnp : Real GNP.
pgnp : Potential real GNP.
ulc : Unit labor cost.
gdfco : Fixed weight deflator for personal consumption expenditure excluding food and energy.
gdf : Fixed weight GNP deflator.
gdfim : Fixed weight import deflator.
gdfcf : Fixed weight deflator for food in personal consumption expenditure.
gdfce : Fixed weight deflator for energy in personal consumption expenditure.

For this problem I have applied the VAR and LSTM models.
